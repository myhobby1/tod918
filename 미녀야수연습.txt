 He lived in a big house by the sea.

 the daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was the
most beautiful of all. In fact, she was so beautiful that

She loved reading. Her two sisters were not very nice though.
 They were selfish and greedy.
They liked to go to parties and to wear nice dresses.
Tjey were always mean to Beauty. They laughed at her when

 One day, there was a terrble storm at sea. All the merchant's
ships sank, so he lost everything. The man had to sell his big
house and move into a small house in the countryside.
 I'm sorry, my children. All my ships sank," said the man. We 
have to work to earn money."
 "But father," said the eldest daughter, "we have never worked in 
our lives. We don't know how to work."
 "We can't work. No rich man will want to marry us!" 
th middle daughter cried.
